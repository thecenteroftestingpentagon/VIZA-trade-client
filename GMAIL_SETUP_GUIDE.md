## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Gmail Authentication Setup Required

The email system is configured but requires Gmail App Password setup to work properly.

## üîß Setup Steps:

### 1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication
1. Go to [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/)
2. Click "Security" in the left sidebar
3. Under "Signing in to Google", click "2-Step Verification"

### 2. Generate App Password

5. Select "Windows Computer" as the device
6. Click "Generate"

### 3. Update Environment Variables
Replace the password in `.env.local`:

```bash
