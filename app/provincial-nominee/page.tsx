              <p className="font-semibold">1. What is the Provincial Nominee Program?</p>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
                The PNP allows Canadian provinces and territories to nominate individuals who have the
                skills, education, and work experience needed to contribute to the local economy and settle
                in that province.

              <p className="font-semibold">2. Which provinces offer PNP streams?</p>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
                Almost all provinces and territories (except Quebec and Nunavut) offer PNP streams.
                Popular ones include Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba.

              <p className="font-semibold">3. What are the eligibility requirements for PNP?</p>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
                Requirements vary by province but usually include having a job offer, relevant work
                experience, education, and language proficiency. Some provinces also target international
                graduates or entrepreneurs.

            <div>
              <p className="font-semibold">4. How do I apply for a PNP nomination?</p>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
                You must apply directly to the province through its PNP portal. If nominated, youâ€™ll receive
                a nomination certificate, which can then be used to apply for permanent residency with IRCC.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <p className="font-semibold">5. Can I apply to multiple provinces?</p>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
                Yes, you can apply to multiple provinces if you meet their eligibility requirements. However,
                you should genuinely intend to live and work in the province where you accept the nomination.

              <p className="font-semibold">6. How does PNP work with Express Entry?</p>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
                Many provinces have Express Entry-linked PNP streams. A provincial nomination gives you
                an additional 600 CRS points, almost guaranteeing an invitation to apply for permanent
                residency.

            <div>
              <p className="font-semibold">7. What are the processing times for PNP?</p>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
                Processing times vary by province but generally range from 2 to 9 months for the provincial
                stage. The federal permanent residency application may take another 6 to 9 months.
